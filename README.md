# Machine-Learning-with-the-Experts--School-Budgets
This project is re-created following a course on Data Camp named Machine Learning with the experts - school budgets. Data science isn't just for predicting ad-clicks-it's also useful for social impact! This project is a case study from a machine learning competition on DrivenData. I explored a problem related to school district budgeting. By building a model to automatically classify items in a school's budget, it makes it easier and faster for schools to compare their spending with other schools. In this project, I began by building a baseline model that is a simple, first-pass approach. In particular, some natural language processing is done to prepare the budgets for modeling. Finally, I was able to see how the winner was able to combine a number of expert techniques to build the most accurate model.
